A quick summary of the project is there are two players, the user and the computer. Each player will have Rock, Paper, and Scissors. First to 7 wins.
Instructions are just press the "Shoot" button until one wins.
I used pygame, simpleGE and this game is based on the petals game.
On the first day, I worked on the foundations which is the background and the game class. Then the next few days are working on the other classes and getting pictures.
I learned how to put pictures in the game and manipulate them.
I got stuck trying to make the pictures correlate with how the game works.
I would like to improve the way the score is working and I would like to invert the picture to face each other.
I would ask the teacher for more help next time.
I changed the other player to a computer.
I worked on it every day and worked on it with my friend.
